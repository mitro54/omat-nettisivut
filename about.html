<div class="biography">
    <p><span>Well, that is me when i was a toddler.</span> <br><br> I didn't start playing around with computers back then just yet,
        <br><span>other than ripping out all the damned keys of that keyboard in the picture...</span> <br><br>
        I actually got my first computer when i was 8 years old, though it took me almost 24 years to figure out my love-hate relationship
        to these machines <br> <span>and realize writing instructions to them is my passion.</span> <br><br> Since the beginning i have figured most of these things on my own as i was
        raised by my grandparents, i was the only person understanding computers in the family. <br><br> But then when i was 16 i was faced with a tough question:
        "When i grow up, what do i want to be?" <span>I would be lying if i told you that i had any clue.</span> I thought maybe repairing cars could be fun because
        all of my closest friends went for that field, but i was pressured to take on the <span>ICT-field</span> because everyone thought that it was the most suited field for me. And it was. <span>I just wasn't ready for it.</span> <br><br>
        Long story short, i was in such a bad place in my teen years that most likely no matter what would have i done,
        would have failed. So i quit school on the last year. Skipping even longer story of my other misery and failures, i learned to be strong, independent, and most importantly, i learned to get shit done. <br><br> 
        <span>Here i am now</span> stronger than ever.
        I started my <span>Web Development</span> journey end of <span>2023</span> and my goal has been to learn something new about computers every day. <span>Going forward that will still be the plan.</span> <br><br>
        I have been self-learning from Udemy and The Odin Project and i am also now in school where <span>i seek to learn more about The Web Development.</span>

        but i guess im an enabler, heh.</p>
